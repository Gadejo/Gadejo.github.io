- Data migration from localStorage to cloud storage
- User profiles with detailed learning analytics and preferences

### **Gamified Study Experience**
- **XP System**: Earn points for completed sessions with different quest types
- **Level Progression**: User leveling based on total XP across all subjects
- **Achievement Engine**: Global achievements with badges and XP rewards
- **Streak Tracking**: Daily study streaks with milestone celebrations
- **Visual Feedback**: Confetti animations, XP notifications, progress bars

### **Flexible Subject Management**
- Create unlimited custom subjects with full configuration control
- Quest types (Easy 5min, Medium 15min, Hard 30min+) with custom XP rewards
- Achievement tiers with emoji rewards and streak requirements
- Resource management for organizing learning materials
- Daily "pips" for micro-study sessions throughout the day

### **Template System**
- Save and share complete subject configurations as templates
- Built-in templates for common subjects (languages, programming, etc.)
- Community template sharing with ratings and downloads
- Export/import functionality for data backup and migration

### **Advanced Analytics**
- Detailed session tracking with mood and difficulty ratings
- Progress charts and statistics across multiple timeframes
- Performance monitoring with real-time metrics
- Goal setting with time-based, session-based, and streak-based targets

## Technical Implementation

### **Performance Optimization**
- Code splitting by feature and vendor libraries
- Lazy loading for non-critical components
- Aggressive caching with proper cache invalidation
- Bundle size optimization with tree shaking
- Real-time performance monitoring and logging

### **User Experience**
- Mobile-first responsive design with touch gesture support
- Dark mode with system preference detection
- Progressive Web App with offline capabilities
- Comprehensive error boundaries with graceful fallbacks
- Loading states and skeleton screens for smooth interactions

### **Security & Reliability**
- Rate limiting per IP with Cloudflare KV storage
- Input validation on all API endpoints
- Secure session management with device tracking
- CORS protection and proper security headers
- Comprehensive error handling throughout the application

## Development & Deployment

### **Development Workflow**
```bash
npm install          # Install dependencies
npm run dev          # Development server with hot reload
npm run build        # Production build with optimization
npm run lint         # TypeScript type checking
npm run cf:dev       # Local development with Cloudflare services
```

### **Database Management**
```bash
npm run db:schema:enhanced  # Apply production schema
npm run db:seed:enhanced   # Load sample data
npm run db:reset           # Full database reset
npm run db:backup          # Create database backup
```

### **Production Deployment**
- **Automatic deployment** from main branch to Cloudflare Pages
- **Preview deployments** for pull requests
- **Environment separation** with dedicated databases and KV namespaces
- **Performance monitoring** and error tracking in production

## API Endpoints
